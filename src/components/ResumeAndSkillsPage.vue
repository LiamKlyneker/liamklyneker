					h3 Netzun #[b 2016 - 2018]
					h4 UX Designer & Creative Front End Developer
					p It is a company that is dedicated to the job market and online education, I was involved in several projects, such as NetzunJobs, an application that initially helped to find work only to students of the last semesters and recent graduates, then moved to be available to all types of users (in Front use VueJS). The other project was NetzunPlus, an application that allows you to take short and concise online classes, its MVP version lasted a long time and since it was already growing and having several features that were not in the initial plans, it became unscalable, then the experience and know what the application needs we had to redo everything from the research to our current and potential users, through the wireframes/designs and ending with the programming part (also used VueJS in Front), thus reaching a super improved version of NetzunPlus, you can visit it if you wish and why not, take a course.

					h3 TheGiftMethod #[b 2015 - 2016]
					h4 Front End Developer & iOS Developer
					p It was my first remote experience, the Product Owner was in San Francisco - USA, the Back End in Lima - Peru and I as Front End in Pasco - Peru (a city very far from the capital), so we were a full remote team of three people, we integrated ourselves like if we been in an office, was a very productive experience, we made several applications including TheGiftMethod, that it had an admin and a webapp that consisted in sell hand picked products from the Amazon API, and recommending the right product to gift to someone special, after that we started an app for iOS called ThoughtRecap, It was a very useful tool that allowed you to write all the thoughts and memories that occurred in the day as in a kind of chat with yourself, apart from my tasks such as Front with Backbone, I learned a lot from Swift, autolayout and all, like I say before was a great experience.

					h3 Freelancer #[b 2014]
					h4 Full Stack Developer
					p At the beginning, like everyone else, I began to look for my life with different projects such as junior developer, some Landings for local companies or non-profit projects served me but the biggest challenge I had at that time was to make the registration and income platform of notes for the Local University (UNDAC), I was there all that year learning a lot and identifying everything that entails making a webapp, as I was just beginning I did not know that there was Back and Front, I saw it as a whole, besides I think there were not several tools direct, only frameworks that allowed you to do all the flow, so the normal thing was to build your API and pass the data to the templates, for all this the team of that time use PHP with Zend Framework. Then I would meet BackboneJS, who was going to be my partner in several future projects.

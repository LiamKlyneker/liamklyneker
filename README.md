Neon.Place is a minimalist app for searching places to rent or buy, such as apartments, offices, and houses. It is designed to be simple and easy to use for both users who want to search and those who want to post listings.

One thing that sets Neon.Place apart is the way in which users can create their listings. Instead of using regular forms, users can create listings live, as if they were building a website. This means that users can see at every moment how their listings will look, by adding images, descriptions, moving elements around, and so on. All of this happens on the same page that final users will see.

This innovative approach makes it easy for users to create beautiful and professional-looking listings, without having any coding experience. It also allows users to be more creative with their listings, and to add unique features that would not be possible with a regular form.

**A note from him** –
_The back-end part of this project was challenging, as I don't consider myself a full-stack developer or at least this was the first project where I perform that role. However, I am a fast learner, and if I don't know something, I am willing to figure out a way to solve a problem. In this case, I spent my time learning FQL, which is the language used by FaunaDB to fine-tune my GraphQL queries. This allowed me to fetch items inside specific map coordinates, add filters, order data, and more. Also, do the integration with Auth0 to handle users and with Postmark to control emails give me the full picture on how all gears of an app work together, simply amazing. **When things are difficult in life and stuff, I feel encouraged by the fact that I managed to figure out the back-end challenges of this project and make it to work properly.** 🙌."_
